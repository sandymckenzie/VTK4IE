\section{Conclusion}

As the user base for VR flourishes, there will be many
new users who look to use VR as a tool for scientific visualization.
Rather than write new algorithms and tools entirely from scratch,
our extensions to the VTK system lowers the hurdles to cleanly
meld community-tested high-quality visualization algorithms into
existing VR integration libraries that can immersively render to
all types of immersive systems, from large walk-in CAVE\texttrademark style displays
to consumer-grade HMDs designed for games and game ecosystems (such
as SteamVR).

VTK has also been enhanced in ways that provide more efficient and,
therefore, faster rendering|orders of magnitude faster in many cases.
Combined, we have moved VTK forward to where it can be \textbf{the}
tool of choice for immersive visualization development.
